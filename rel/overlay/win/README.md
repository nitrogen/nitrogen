# Compiling Nitrogen on Windows

**Windows support is experimental in Nitrogen.**

### Notes:

**Note 1:** This process can be a hair tedius, but will allow you to have the latest
and greatest version of Nitrogen from Github.com.  For the version that doesn't
require you to screw around with installing msysgit, download the prepackaged
Windows zip file from the [Nitrogen Home Page](http://www.nitrogenproject.com)

**Note 2:** To simplify the releasing of Nitrogen on Windows, some significant
changes have been made to the build process. The previous method required a
lot of tinkering with things to build with a new release of Erlang.

## Prerequisite Steps:

1. Install [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) (Recommended R15B+) for Windows into `c:\erl5.9`
2. Make sure `c:\erl5.9\bin` is in your windows PATH
3. Get [Msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list) and install to `c:\msysgit` (the default). 

**Note**: Download the Msysgit netinstaller, **not** the fullinstaller.  The 
fullinstaller does not come with some necessary tools (particularly a working
`make`), despite the misleading name

## To Build Nitrogen

1. Fire up msysgit
2. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to install Nitrogen
3. `git clone https://github.com/nitrogen/nitrogen`
4. `cd nitrogen`
5. `make rel_inets_win` or (`make rel_mochiweb_win`)
6. When it completes, you'll have a standalone installation in rel/nitrogen
7. You can close Msysgit now.

**Note:** You only need to use msysgit for when you want to build Nitrogen.
Once it's built, you can run Nitrogen from the normal Windows Explorer

## Running Nitrogen

1. Close Msysgit and open Windows Explorer to where you installed Nitrogen
2. Run (double-click) `start.cmd`
3. Navigate your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`


I realize this is not exactly the *simplest* set of instructions, but it allows
us to use some build tools otherwise inconvenient to use on windows.  As stated
above, Windows support is **EXPERIMENTAL** so, please understand that.
