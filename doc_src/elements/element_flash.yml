description: >
  The flash element defines a placeholder for flash messages. Flash messages are created
  with the wf:flash/1 command. This command can take either plain text, or one or more Nitrogen
  elements which will be rendered inside of the flash tag. Any postback actions within these elements
  are fed back to the current page.
