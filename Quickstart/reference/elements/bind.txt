{description, "
	The bind element allows you to easily display lists of data on a Nitrogen page. When you declare
	the bind element, you define a set of 'data', a 'body' containing one or more elements, and a 'map'
	that tells the bind element how to map a data row into the body.
	<p>
	A map item is an atom of the form element_id@attribute. The element_id must correspond to the id of
	an element in the 'body', and the attribute must be an attribute found on that element. You can bind to
	any attribute within an element.
	<p>
	In addition, you can specify a 'transform' function to manipulate the data at bind time and add
	additional bindings dynamically.
	<p>
	The 'data' attribute and the 'map' attribute must follow the same basic structure. This can mean one of three things:
	<h4>Simple List</h4>
	If the data is a simple list, then each row must be of the same length, and the map must also be the same length as a data row.
	<p>
	<h4>Key/Value Pair</h4>
	If the data is in the form of a key/value pair, then each row must be a list of {key, value} tuples, and the map must also be a list of {key, value} tuples. 
	The tuples can be in any order, and there can be extra tuples or missing tuples with no ill effects.
	<p>
	<h4>Records</h4>
	If the data is in the form of a record, then each row must be the same type of record, and the map must be a record.
	<p>
	The bind element can be nested within itself.
